The Ireland always was Catholic. James I sent a group of protestant people trying to convert Ireland's Catholics to Anglicanism.
This conversion wasn't that gentile, because he thought in the *divine right* (the king has been chosen by god). ==**DIVINE POWER OF THE KING**==

James was **absolutist** and he didn't like the parliament, and he summoned it rarely, only when he needed money.

James **was protestant** so he wanted to make the people read the bible. He had made make a translation of the bible that's also used today: "*James's translation of bible*".

It started the **Gunpowder plot** (*"il complotto della polvere da sparo"*), where some people (commanded by *Guy Fawkes*) who didn't liked James wanted to blow up the parliament while the king and the parliament was inside. They were arrested before making it appened, and they were burned at the stake. Every 5th of november (the day when they wanted to blow up everything), also now, they burn some bonfires, with at the top with *Guy Fawkes*' symbol, to *remember the five of november*.
# The puritans (aka pilgrims fathers)
In these moments returned the puritans from the purge made by Elizabeth. They were a group of strict protestants. They believed in:
- Predestination ("god has a plan for u"), so "what can I do to become what i am predestinated to become?": I've to
	- Study
	- **work hard** (the most important value)
	- stay alive

In 1620, the Mayflower (a ship), with onboard a hundred of puritans on it, sailed from Plymouth in the direction of *Virginia*, who wanted to recreate the new england (the east coast of US).

The american mentality comes from this people, even now is at the core.

The thanksgiving day is celebrated in the $4^{th} november$.
> When they arrived in America, they tried to coltivate, but it was nearly winter and it was a different land. The people who lived in america before them, helped them, in the 1621 the harvest was really good, and with the thanksgiving they celebrated the new friendship.

This story was not right, they enslaved the natives, deprived them of lands and killed them, it was a *genocide*.

The war is won by the Roundheads, and the house of commons remained the only remaining house of the parliament.

Charles the I has been beheaded in 1649, the monarchy is abolished and the royal family is exiled in france
