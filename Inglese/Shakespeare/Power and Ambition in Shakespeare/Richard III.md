Setting: London. 1480
(... -> 1485) the war of the roses, king Henry VII Tudor (Lancaster) + Elizabeth York

Henry VII was the duke of Richmond, who married "the young Elizabeth".

Characters:
- Richard III: he is
	- the protagonist
	- a villain
	- the brother of King Edward IV and Clarence
	- A Machiavellian charater: the end justifies the means:
		- He locks, said that they are illegitimate, and kills Edward and Richard
		- He kills Clarence
		- He kills his first wife
		- He marry lady Anne (after he killed his husband and his father)
		- He killed hastings
	- Probably was protrayed so bad for propaganda (actual queen (Elizabeth I) was the granddoughter of "Richmond")
- Edward IV
	- Edward: Edward IV's son
	- Richard: Edward IV's son
- Clarence
- Richmond: Hanry VII
- Women:
	- Lady Anne: not easly manupulated
	- Queen Elizabeth: clever
	- Queen Margaret: prophetic (6th sense)
	- Richard's mother: Ballsy

Themes:
- machiavellian characters are self-destructive
- manipulation

The play start with a Soliloquy (one pearson explaining his thoughts) from Richard III.
