*Uncle Richard's castle looked dark and frightening. I wondered what a weekend staying with him would be like. the door opened and* inside I saw a big lavish room, with a lot of paintings on the wall. In the front of the door there was a sumptuous staircase, with a golden handrail.
Around the castle, there was hundreds of rooms, with hundreds of servants that was running in all directions doing their work. The one with the trays for the dinner, other ones with carafe, other with red embroided bed sheets.
at every door there was two guards, and my uncle was followed by four guards. Everyone hated him, and for the fear he was spending a lot of money for his bodyguards, that was being payed so they won't betray him. The garden behind the castle was huge, full of plants and flowers. It wasn't visible from the outside of the castle. It could beat Versailles.
The castle was enclosed by big dark ramparts, the outside looked dark, but only the outside, like my uncle, that showed him as a terrible pearson, but inside he have a golden heart (he also didn't realized that).

Dear organizers,
I've recently played your Murder Mystery Weekend and I really enjoied it, but I've a few suggestion to improve it.
First, it would be great if the event was aviable all the year, not just in August, this could permits to join to more people. The room was too cold and small, that made him not very comfortable. The food wasn't very good, maybe you can change the men√π.
The actors were fantastic and really scary! I loved the mountain walks, but the pool was too cold to use.
