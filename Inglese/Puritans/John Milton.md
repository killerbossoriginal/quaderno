[Paradise Lost](Paradise%20Lost.md): the story of lucifer, Adams and Eve expulsion from paradise and Eden
Paradise Regained: the story of 40 days of Jesus Crist in the desert fasting, and for this the humans regained the paradise.

Ragion of the writing of Paradise Lost
- it was a strong religious man - Puritan (moral lessons, sin, religion)
- it hid his political message
- wrote during the restauration so he had to hide his thought (if it was a poem about Cromwell)
