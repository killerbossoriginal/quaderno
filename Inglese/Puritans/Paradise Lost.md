Lucifer:
- One of God's sons
- Was the most beautiful angel
- Was jealous of God and Jesus Christ
- He wanted to rule, so he started a war that he lost
- He was sent to hell, and he assumes from here the name of Satan

Lucifer was furious, vengeful and wanted to punish god after his defeat. He wanted to hurt the most important thing god created: *the human being*, by corrupting Adams and Eve.

God asked to Adams and Eve not to eat from the tree of knowledge, but the snake (Lucifer) convinced Eve to eat an apple from that tree. Adams didn't want to stay alone in the Eden Garden, so he ate an apple too to be banned to the world.

This text is a rewriting of the Genesis and had a hidden political message.
If it his a political metaphor than who is Satan? It could be
- Charles I (hell -> his execution)
- Stuart family (hell -> France (*LO SAPEVO*))
- Pilgrim Fathers (hell -> America)
- **Oliver Cromwell (god -> king, hell -> commonwealth)**
- John Milton (the author of the text, hell -> is blindness & imprisonment)

This is:
- A religious narrative poem
	- Lucifer as the protagonist
	- that tells a story about Lucifer deeds
	- is an **Epic Poem**.
	- is a medias res (it start *during* an action, not at his beginning)
	- with themes:
		- freedom & free will
		- rebellion
		- human weaknesses
