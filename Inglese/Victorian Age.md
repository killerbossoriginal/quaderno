The queen Victoria succeeded her uncle William IV in 1937, when she was 18.
She married Albert and had nine children with him. This family was seen as a respectable model, until 1861 when Albert died.
She made social and political reforms.

In 1938, some people created the Chartism, demanding the right to vote to **all male adults** and some other objectives like the secret ballot.
In 1947 it was approved an act called "ten hours act", limiting the hours of work.

There were two political parties, Liberals (formerly Whigs, wanted free trade and didn't wanted Corn Laws) and conservatives (formerly Tories).

In Ireland there was a potato famine that brought poverty and death.

Industry and trade flourished, with new scientific and technological developments, that were also exposed to the [[Esposizioni#1851 - Londra|Great Exposition of 1851]].
Increased railway building and manufacturing production.

## 6.4
The first years of Victoria’s reign were a period of social reforms and political developments, unprecedented material progress and also one of imperial expansion. The merits of these achievements partly belonged to the queen, who, in marked contrast with other European monarchs, reigned constitutionally, avoiding the storm of revolution which spread all over Europe in 1848. *She never overruled Parliament and became a mediator above party politics.*

During these years, there was a strong working-class movement calling for social reform. The Great Reform Act of 1832 had extended the vote to almost all male members of the middle classes, but had done little for the working class. The movement of Chartism played an important role, drawing up the ‘People’s Charter’ in 1838, which called for social reforms and the extension of the right to vote to all male adults. *The movement slowly died but many of its objectives, like the use of a secret ballot, were later achieved through Parliament.*
Other social reforms regulating factory life followed, like the Ten Hours Act of 1847, which limited working hours to ten a day for all labourers.

On a political level, the two main parties were the Liberals, mainly formed from the former Whigs, and the Conservatives, who evolved from the old Tories. *These two important political parties alternated in government.*
The Liberals promoted a strong campaign for free trade that led to the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. These laws had maintained the price of corn artificially high to protect the landowners’ interests. The repeal of the Corn Laws was also an attempt to help the situation in Ireland, where a disease affecting potatoes, their main produce, had led to the Potato Famine and numerous deaths.

Social unrest did not prevent the increasing power of the middle classes or the expansion of industry and trade. This was also aided by the considerable scientific and technological developments taking place.  
In foreign policy, this was a period of great expansion in trade, as the abundance of manufactured goods needed new markets. *This foreign trade was so important that England was prepared to fight wars to protect its trading routes.* 
There were two Opium Wars against China in 1839–1842 and in 1856–1860, which gave Britain access to five Chinese ports and the control of Hong Kong. Along with France, Britain sided with the Ottoman Empire against Russia during the Crimean War, between 1853 and 1856, as a way of containing Russian influence in this sensitive area. *Britain also supported some liberal causes abroad, like the Italian struggle for independence.*

The most important and lucrative zone of influence for Britain, however, was undoubtedly India. A dangerous crisis arose here in 1857 with the so-called ‘Indian Mutiny’, when Indian soldiers rebelled against their British commanders. They were backed by local rulers and thousands of local people. The uprising was against the rule of the British East India Company, which functioned as a sovereign power on behalf of the British Crown. *It was eventually put down but marked an important change in Anglo-Indian relations.*
The East India Company was dissolved and India was administered directly by the British government. Queen Victoria issued a proclamation to Indians in November 1858 which promised them rights similar to those of other British subjects.
## 8.2
By the middle of the 19th century, Britain had become a nation of town dwellers due **to** its extraordinary industrial development. The census of 1851 recorded half of the population of Britain as living in towns, and finding solutions to problems linked to the overcrowded urban environment was at the **heart** of Victorian political and social reforms. The majority of Victorian city poor lived in unhealthy slum **districts** overrun by disease and crime. Here the mortality rate was high and the terrible working conditions in polluted environments had a disastrous effect, especially on children’s health. Two Housing Acts were passed in 1851 to clean up the towns which had been devastated by frequent **epidemics** of cholera and typhoid carried by polluted water. However, the changes and the effects were slow. As a result, for every grand public building built, just **around**  the corner there were rows of appalling terraced houses and slums.

There was widespread poverty with relief only available to those who agreed to live in workhouses. The homeless, unemployed, orphaned and abandoned children as **well** as the disabled, elderly and unmarried mothers were given a place to live in these institutions in return for their labour. Medicine also underwent a radical change. Modern hospitals were built and professional organisations were **founded** to regulate and control medical education and research.  
Other changes concerned the gradual introduction of services such as running water, gas, street lighting and paved roads. Places of entertainment **like** public houses, music halls, parks and stadiums were built. Solid Victorian buildings from this time – prisons, police stations, boarding schools and town halls – can still be seen in British cities today.

## 9 - THE VICTORIAN COMPROMISE
The Victorian Age was a complex and contradictory era: on the one hand, it was the age of progress brought about by the Industrial Revolution, the rising wealth of the upper and middle classes, stability and great social reforms; on the other hand, it was also characterised by poverty, injustice and social unrest.

The Victorians were great moralisers: they faced a large number of problems on such a scale that they felt obliged to support certain values which offered solutions or a way out. Thus, they promoted a code of values that reflected the world as they wanted it to be, not as it really was, based on duties, hard work, respectability and charity. These values were refined by the upper and middle classes, who had political and economic power, but they were equally applied to all strata of society.

In fact, one of the most important notions throughout the 19th century was the need to work hard. In an age which believed in progress, it seemed natural to believe that material progress would result from hard work and to insist on a sense of duty rather than on personal inclination.

The idea of being respectable distinguished the middle from the lower classes. Respectability was a mixture of both morality and hypocrisy, severity and conformity to
social standards. It implied the possession of good manners, the ownership of a comfortable house with servants and a carriage, regular attendance at church and charitable activities.

Philanthropy was a widespread phenomenon: it applied to every kind of poverty, to 'stray children, fallen women and drunken men', and absorbed the energies of thousands of
Victorians, many of whom were women. Middle-class ideals dominated Victorian family life. The family was a patriarchal unit where the husband represented authority and the key role of women concerned the education of children and the management of the house.

Victorian society was deeply concerned about female chastity and unmarried mothers were marginalised as 'fallen women'. Sexuality was generally repressed in its public and private forms, and moralising 'prudery' in its most extreme manifestations led to the denunciation of nudity in art, the veiling of sculptured genitals and the rejection of words with a sexual connotation from everyday vocabulary.
