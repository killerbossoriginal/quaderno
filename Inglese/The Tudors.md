Henry VII made sure that his children could get married with important people:

# Henry VIII
Henry VIII was a great catholic, he has been granted the "*defender of faith*" (*difensore del credo*) title.
He had a problem, he was married with Catherine of Aragon, that give him only a daughter (**Mary I**).

So he wanted to annul, using as excuse that the bible said that you can't marry the widow of your own brother. The pope said not (because Catherine of Aragon was related to Charles V)

So in **1534** we have the schism of Anglicanism (**the Act of Supremacy**). The monks gone away and the the king sold the monasteries.

He married Anne Boleyn, but he gave him another daughter (**Elizabeth I**), so he accused her of treason and decapitated her.

He has been married less than a month later, and she finally got him a boy, **Edward VI**.

She wanted to restore the **Catholicism** only for going against his father.

The Renaissance started because the classical (greek-roman) texts, after the fall of Costantinopoli and the Bizantine Empire, moved from the east to the west.
